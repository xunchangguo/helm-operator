# Helm Operator

The Helm Operator is a [Kubernetes operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/),
allowing one to declaratively manage Helm chart releases. Combined with
[Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux) this can be utilized to automate
releases in a GitOps manner, but the usage of Flux is not a strict
requirement.

The desired state of a Helm release is described through a Kubernetes
Custom Resource named `HelmRelease`. Based on the creation, mutation or
removal of a `HelmRelease` resource in the cluster, Helm actions are
performed by the operator.

## Features

* Declarative install, upgrade, and delete of Helm releases
* Pulls chart from _any_ chart source;
    * Public or private Helm repositories over HTTP/S
    * Public or private Git repositories over HTTPS or SSH
    * Any other public or private chart source using one of the available
      [Helm downloader plugins](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/plugins/#downloader-plugins)
* Allows Helm values to be specified;
    * In-line in the `HelmRelease` resource
    * In (external) sources, e.g. `ConfigMap` and `Secret` resources,
      or a (local) URL
* Automated purging on release install failures
* Automated (optional) rollback on upgrade failures
* Automated image upgrades [using Flux](https://docs.fluxcd.io/en/stable/references/helm-operator-integration.html)
* Automated (configurable) chart dependency updates for Helm charts
  from Git sources on install or upgrade
* Detection and recovery from Helm storage mutations
  (e.g. a manual Helm release that was made but conflicts with the
  declared configuration for the release)
* Parallel and scalable processing of different `HelmRelease` resources
  using workers
* Supports both Helm 2 and 3
