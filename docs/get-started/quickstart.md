# Quickstart

This guide walks you through to all steps required to quickly get
started with the Helm Operator.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster **>=1.13.0**
- Up-to-date **Helm 2 or 3** [`helm` binary](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases)
- `kubectl`

## Install the Helm Operator

First, install the `HelmRelease` Custom Resource Definition. By adding
this CRD it will be possible to define `HelmRelease` resources on the
cluster:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluxcd/helm-operator/{{ version }}/deploy/crds.yaml
```

Create a new namespace:

```sh
kubectl create ns flux
```

Using `helm`, first add the Flux CD Helm repository:

```sh
helm repo add fluxcd https://charts.fluxcd.io
```

Next, install the Helm Operator using the available Helm chart:

```sh
helm upgrade -i helm-operator fluxcd/helm-operator \
    --namespace flux \
    --set helm.versions=v3
```

This installs the Helm Operator with default settings and support for
Helm 3 enabled.

!!! hint
    See the [operator reference](../references/operator.md) and [chart
    documentation](../references/chart.md#configuration)
    for detailed configuration options.

## Create your first `HelmRelease`

To install a Helm chart using the Helm Operator, create a `HelmRelease`
resource on the cluster:

```sh
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: helm.fluxcd.io/v1
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: podinfo
  namespace: default
spec:
  chart:
    repository: https://stefanprodan.github.io/podinfo
    name: podinfo
    version: 3.2.0
EOF
```

The applied resource will install the [`podinfo`
chart](https://github.com/stefanprodan/podinfo) with a tiny Go web
application from a Helm repository chart source. _Chart sources_ are
references to places where the operator can find Helm charts. The
release name the Helm Operator will use is composed out of the 
namespace and name of the `HelmRelease` resource (but can be
configured): `default-podinfo`.

!!! hint
    Read more about different chart sources in the [chart
    sources](../helmrelease-guide/chart-sources.md) section of the
    `HelmRelease` guide.
    
## Confirm the chart has been installed

When a Helm chart has been successfully released the Helm Operator will
push a condition of type `Released` with status `True`. You can check 
this condition is set using `kubectl`:

```console
$ kubectl wait --for=condition=released helmrelease/podinfo
helmrelease.helm.fluxcd.io/podinfo condition met
```

Or, by describing the `HelmRelease` itself:

```console
$ kubectl describe helmrelease podinfo
Name:         podinfo
Namespace:    default
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration:
                {"apiVersion":"helm.fluxcd.io/v1","kind":"HelmRelease","metadata":{"annotations":{},"name":"podinfo","namespace":"default"},"spec":{"chart...

Confirm the `default-podinfo` pod has been deployed:

```console
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
default-podinfo-7f9759cc66-bslsl   1/1     Running   0          59s
```

!!! tip
    The available shorthand for `kubectl` operations on `helmrelease`
    resources is `hr`, i.e:
    
    ```console
    $ kubectl get hr
    NAME      RELEASE           STATUS     MESSAGE                       AGE
    podinfo   default-podinfo   deployed   Helm release sync succeeded   59s
    ```

## Make a modification

The Helm Operator ensures that the Helm release in the cluster matches
the defined state in the `HelmRelease` resource. This means that an
upgrade will be performed when the resource is modified. To demonstrate
this, we are going to increase the number of `podinfo` replicas:

```sh
kubectl edit helmrelease/podinfo
```

[Helm values](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/values/#helm)
can be defined on the `HelmRelease` resources under the  `spec.values`
key:

```yaml
...
spec:
  chart:
    name: podinfo
    repository: https://stefanprodan.github.io/podinfo
    version: 3.2.0
  values:
    replicaCount: 2
```

Save the modification and watch the new pod enroll:

```console
$ kubectl get pods -w
NAME                               READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
default-podinfo-7f9759cc66-lk45t   1/1     Running             0          59s
default-podinfo-7f9759cc66-w7fj7   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          1s
default-podinfo-7f9759cc66-w7fj7   0/1     Running             0          1s
default-podinfo-7f9759cc66-w7fj7   1/1     Running             0          1s
```

!!! hint
    See the [values](../helmrelease-guide/values.md) and [release
    configuration](../helmrelease-guide/release-configuration.md)
    sections in the `HelmRelease` guide for more details.

## Reconciliation

All `HelmRelease` resources in the cluster watched by a Helm Operator
instance are rescheduled to synchronize every 3 minutes (or configured
`--charts-sync-interval`); this is also known as the reconciliation
loop.

During reconciliation the result of a dry-run upgrade made with the
`HelmRelease` resource is compared to the current deployed Helm
release, and if they differ an upgrade is performed to ensure the defined
and in-cluster state match again.

You can experience this with your own eyes by rolling back the
modification we just made using `helm`, the Helm Operator created
the release with a name composed of the namespace and name of the
`HelmRelease`:

```console
$ helm rollback podinfo
Rollback was a success! Happy Helming!
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                               READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
default-podinfo-7f9759cc66-w7fj7   1/1     Terminating   0          1m1s
default-podinfo-7f9759cc66-lk45t   1/1     Running       0          2m1s
```

Watch the Helm Operator reverting the unauthorized modification (this
can take a while, but no longer than 3 minutes):

```console
$ kubectl get pods -w
NAME                               READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
default-podinfo-7f9759cc66-lk45t   1/1     Running             0          2m19s
default-podinfo-7f9759cc66-kd5rk   0/1     Pending             0          0s
default-podinfo-7f9759cc66-kd5rk   0/1     Pending             0          0s
default-podinfo-7f9759cc66-kd5rk   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          0s
default-podinfo-7f9759cc66-kd5rk   0/1     Running             0          1s
default-podinfo-7f9759cc66-kd5rk   1/1     Running             0          7s
```

    upgrades](../helmrelease-guide/reconciliation-and-upgrades.md) in
    the `HelmRelease` guide.
    
## Uninstalling the chart

To uninstall the chart and clean up the release, simply run `kubectl
delete` for the resource:

```sh
kubectl delete helmrelease podinfo
```

```console
$ kubectl get pods -w
NAME                               READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
default-podinfo-7f9759cc66-fr4vb   1/1     Terminating   0          3m30s
default-podinfo-7f9759cc66-kd5rk   1/1     Terminating   0          1m6s
default-podinfo-7f9759cc66-kd5rk   0/1     Terminating   0          1m8s
default-podinfo-7f9759cc66-fr4vb   0/1     Terminating   0          3m32s
```

Delete the Helm Operator by removing the `fluxcd` namespace:

```sh
kubectl delete namespace flux
```
